Summary

You can use the web console or the oc and odo CLIs to deploy applications in Red Hat OpenShift.
In the web console, the developer perspective streamlines the application development experience by providing multiple methods to deploy applications.
These methods include deploying applications and services by using container images, Git repositories, Helm charts, or operator-backed services.
You can apply these deployment methods from the developer perspective, or by using the CLIs.
The administrator perspective of the web console focuses on cluster administration.
The topology screen of the developer perspective displays deployed applications in a graph view.


Know how to:
- Manage applications with the web console
- Create and work with multiple OpenShift projects
- Create and deploy single container and multi-container applications from Git, specific from a directory, from an image, from stream
- Use application health monitoring
- Configure the OpenShift internal registry to meet specific requirements
